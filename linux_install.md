# So you've decided to install Linux.

There's a ton of ways to go about it, most of them relatively easy. In this guide we'll be covering a concise, step-by-step guide to installing Linux.
This guide only covers two distros of Linux, and there will be a section on the reasons for choosing one over the other.
We will also be covering three different ways of installing Linux for both distros discussed.

The distros used in this guide are:
	<pre>
	* Kali Linux
	* Ubuntu
	</pre>
	
The Installation methods we will cover are:
	<pre>
	* Installing the OS on a Virtual Machine (We will cover both VMWare and VirtualBox)
	* Installing the OS on a USB drive with Persistence enabled
	* Wiping the Hard Drive and performing a clean installation of the OS
